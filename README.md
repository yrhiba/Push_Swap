# Push_Swap
The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project: data must be sorted.

Because Swap_push isn’t as natural!

We have at our disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions
to manipulate both stacks.

The goal? A program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
that sorts the integers received as arguments.

Easy?

We’ll see...
